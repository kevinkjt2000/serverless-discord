# C++ Serverless Discord Bot
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Welcome to a ðŸ’ª project of mine where I wanted to use my AWS and C++ knowledge to make a Discord bot that relies on [Slash Commands](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands) for input. Once things settle down a bit in this repo, I'll revisit the docs here to describe how to build and deploy this. For now, if you're interested or have questions, hop onto our [C++ Discord](https://discord.com/channels/216010419213434882/350062491088453634/350065188944478209) and ping `@kevinkjt2000#2000` in `#project-discussions`.
